# rusty_pong
A Pong game written in Rust.

The original author of [rusty_pong](https://github.com/TanTanDev/rusty_pong) is [TanTan](https://github.com/TanTanDev). You can find the original youtube video that explains the beginnings of this tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/TUE_HSgQiG0).

I have forked TanTan's version and refactored and improved it slightly while still trying to stick with the original simple game idea.

This simple project is a learning exercise for myself on using the rust ecosystem and its tools for game development.
